Understanding the Basics of Real Estate Photography
Publishing a real estate listing without photos a risky gamble: potential buyers, deprived of visuals, cannot picture themselves in the property for sale. Moverover, according to the Behavioral and Experimental Real Estate Institute, 60% of the time spent on a listing is devoted to viewing the photos of the property, compared to just 20% spent reading the description. It’s therefore crucial to publish high-quality images to increase the chances of selling properties quickly.

Have you ever thought about what makes real estate photography so unique compared to other types of photography? We need to understand its transformative impact on the real estate sector.

‍

The Importance of Images in Real Estate
When it comes to selling a property, the quality of the listing is paramount. Photos play a crucial role in allowing potential buyers to visualize the property and appreciate its qualities. Photos provide the opportunity to pique interest and encourage viewings.

According to the study mentioned previously, t95% of visitors look at the initial photo in just 20 seconds. It’s therefore essential to take care of every detail to capture attention from the very first glance. And according to a study by the National Association of Realtors, homes with high-quality photography sell 32% faster!

‍

According to a study by the National Association of Realtors, homes with high-quality photography sell 32% faster.
‍

Potential Buyers Need to See Themselves in The Property
The photos of your properties should be authentic, attractive, and impactful.

Authentic - the photos should enhance the property without changing it. We want to avoid disappointments during viewings by ensuring images perfectly reflect the property while showcasing it in its best light.
Attractive - your photos should grab visitors' attention in seconds, getting clicks, interest, and viewings (and hopefully a sale!)
Lastly, they must be impactful. Visitors should be able to project themselves in the space thanks to your photos, leaving a lasting impression in their memory and making them want to visit it in person.
‍

Discover the Best Techniques for Capturing Quality Images
‍

How to Choose the Right Equipment for Real Estate Photography?
Now, you might be thinking, ""Do I need high-end equipment to capture stunning real estate photos?"" Not necessarily. The key is to choose the right equipment.

ProperShot enables you to capture entire rooms without distortion, making spaces look larger and more inviting. No other equipment is needed, not even a tripod.

A range of image editing software options are available, each offering specific features. Among the most popular is Photoshop, known for its versatility but with a steep learning curve. Others like ProperShot provide a suite of automated editing tools, including the Magic Eraser and Home Staging, allowing you to transform spaces and remove imperfections in seconds, delivering flawless results instantly.

‍

Lighting is Crucial in Real Estate Photography.
It's not just about brightness; it's about mood, depth, and texture. When a room is well-lit, it appears more welcoming and spacious, two key factors that attract potential buyers.

Poor weather conditions may not allow for optimal lighting. ProperShot lets you to change the sky thanks to its dedicated sky replacement feature, transforming a grey sky into sunny weather!

‍

What are the Best Angles for Shooting a Property?
Capturing the proper shot in real estate isn't just about snapping a photo; it's about finding the right angle. The best angles are those that showcase the property's strengths while minimizing its weaknesses. For example, shooting from a corner can make a room look more spacious, and capturing a home from a slightly elevated angle can make the property appear more grand and imposing. Try to show as much floor as possible, it will make the room look bigger! And don’t worry about proportions with ProperShot, our AI will make every corner straight.

‍

Keeping you Real Estate Photos Authentic and Mastering Home Staging
Editing your photos can be wise to correct minor imperfections, such as the brightness or contrast. However, it's crucial to do so with carefully and with transparency. Excessive editing risks misleading potential buyers and compromising trust. Therefore, it's recommended to clearly indicate in the listing if the images have been retouched, to avoid any ambiguity during visits.

Staging a room to make it look lived-in but not cluttered is an art. Proper furniture arrangement and decor can help potential buyers imagine themselves living in the space. Try ProperShot's Home Staging feature! Some users like to publish both photos - before and after home staging - to give the buyer ideas, but also show the original photo.

Last of all, remove unnecessary items to create a clean space, or use ProperShot's Magic Eraser to do it in just a few clicks.

‍

ProperShot, an increasingly popular solution, offers automated editing thanks to AI, as well as user-friendly tools like the ""magic eraser."" The new Home Staging feature even allows for a quick interior makeover in just a couple of clicks, making it a powerful and effective solution to enhance your real estate listings.
‍

To sum up
Real estate photography is all about presenting a property in its best light, both literally and figuratively. Images are much more than just illustrations: they are an essential tool to attract the attention and interest of potential buyers. By ensuring quality and authentic pictures, you give yourself every chance for a successful sale.

HDR Photography in Real Estate: A Game Changer
Have you ever wondered why some property listings just seem to jump off the screen, while others fade into the background? The secret might just lie in a powerful tool called HDR photography. But what is HDR, and why is it becoming a real estate game changer?

‍

What is HDR Photography?
HDR, or High Dynamic Range photography, is more than just a buzzword in the real estate market. It's a technique that combines multiple shots of the same scene taken at different exposures. The result? Images that are rich in detail, offering a more realistic and vibrant view of the property. It's like seeing the world through a high-definition lens, where every color pops and every shadow reveals hidden details.

‍

Why HDR in Real Estate?
Now, why is this important in real estate? Let's face it, buying a house is a big decision, and first impressions count. In a world where online listings can make or break a sale, HDR photos stand out. They provide a clearer, more detailed view of a property, helping potential buyers visualise themselves in the space. This isn't just speculation – studies have shown that listings with high-quality photos sell quicker and often at higher prices. It's simple, really: better photos lead to more interest, which can lead to a quicker sale at a better price.

‍

Listings with high-quality photos sell quicker and often at higher prices.
‍

HDR vs. Traditional Photography
But how does HDR compare to traditional photography? Traditional interior photos can often suffer from overexposure or underexposure, failing to capture the full range of light and dark in a room. HDR solves this by balancing the light, ensuring that no area is too bright or too dark. The difference is stark. With HDR, the sunlight streaming through a window won't wash out the room, and you can still see the view outside. It's about creating a balance and showing the property in the best possible light – quite literally.

‍

‍


‍

‍Implementing HDR Photography
Implementing HDR photography in your listings isn't as daunting as it might sound - you can get professional HDR photos with your smartphone. Mobile apps like ProperShot have integrated HDR in their solution. If you take pictures with your phone, focus on them!

‍

Properties with HDR photos stay on the market for less time – up to 32% shorter than listings with standard photos.
‍

The Business Impact
The impact of HDR on real estate marketing is significant. In an industry where selling a lifestyle is just as important as selling a property, HDR helps paint the picture. It's about creating an emotional response. When a potential buyer looks at a photo without HDR, they will be ""blinded"" by the overexposure of the window. During a visit, they would never be affected by what a photo could convey. Thus, HDR allows, through the balance of light, shadows, contrast in a photo, to bring realism to the potential buyer. Real estate listings with professional photos, including HDR images, see a 47% higher asking price per square foot. They also stay on the market for less time – up to 32% shorter than listings with standard photos.

A Final Thought
HDR is more than just a trend in the real estate world; it's a vital tool for showcasing properties in their best light. It offers a clearer, more detailed representation of a property for potential buyers. Understanding and utilizing HDR photography can significantly impact how quickly and profitably you can sell a property. Remember, in the competitive world of real estate, every advantage counts, and HDR is a technological edge that's hard to overlook.",https://www.propershot.com/blog/hdr-bracketing-photography-in-real-estate-enhancing-property-images-for-impact

‍

The gap between smartphone and professional camera image quality is narrowing faster than ever.
‍

The Art of Composition and Editing: Making Your Property Pop
‍

Composition Techniques to Elevate Real Estate Photos
Great composition is what separates a good photo from a great one. The rule of thirds, leading lines, and playing with perspectives can make your property photos stand out. The ProperShot app has an integrated gyroscope to help you take the best angle. Try to show as much floor as possible, it will broaden the room! And don’t worry about proportions with ProperShot, the AI enhancements will make every corner look straight.

‍

Editing for Impact: Bringing Your Real Estate Photos to Life

At ProperShot, we know that photos are essential for selling a real estate property. A buyer’s first impression of a listing comes from its photos. The experience of Clément Pelloquin, a real estate agent working at L'Adresse with 7 years of experience in the industry, demonstrates how our photo retouching platform can truly make a difference.


Clément Pelloquin - Real Estate Agent


Why ProperShot?
Clément's answer is clear and meaningful: ""All of the agents in the agency now use ProperShot because it’s easy to use, fast, and efficient! Imagine having to manage a team where everyone has their own method for taking photos, using different equipment. It can quickly become a logistical nightmare.""Before adopting ProperShot, his agency’s listings lacked visual consistency. ""The framing, brightness, and contrast were never correctly calibrated,"" he says. This inconsistency harmed the agency’s professional image.

‍

What prompted you to change your habits and adopt ProperShot?
It’s the efficiency and simplicity of ProperShot.

""Since using ProperShot, each agent has been able to install the app on their smartphone and they all quickly mastered the tool. The app allows for automatic album processing in just a few minutes. The photos are ready to be published almost immediately after being taken. All that’s left is to email the photos and/or download the album via the platform, and the photos are ready to be published on your listing.""
The user interface is another major advantage of ProperShot that made adoption very smooth.

""The app is simple, smooth, and intuitive, allowing for optimal use of its features.""
For real estate agents constantly on the move, an easy-to-use app is essential. ProperShot offers a seamless user experience, making photo taking and processing a breeze.

Finally, another strong point of ProperShot is the quality of its customer service. For real estate professionals who often have tight deadlines, responsive and efficient customer support is indispensable.

""The customer and technical support is the most responsive and pleasant service I know among all brands/companies.""
‍

Your favorite features?
Among the most appreciated features by Clément and his team, sending albums by email directly after leaving a property tops the list.
